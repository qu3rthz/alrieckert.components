RTTI Controls for LCL

RTTI stands for the FreePascal Run Time Type Information.
The RTTI controls can be connected to published properties of TPersistant
objects (e.g. any LCL or FCL component). For example you can connect a
TTICheckBox to the Visible property of a TButton.
The IDE uses the RTTI for the Object Inspector and defines a lot of property
editors. The RTTI controls use these property editors, so it can edit anything
the Object Inspector can edit. But contrary to the Inspector the RTTI controls
are not limited to TEdit and TComboBox.
