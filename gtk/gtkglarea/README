Package GtkOpenGL

Contains the lcl component TGTKGLAreaControl, which wraps the gtkglarea, a
gtk widget for opengl. This component works only with the gtk interface.

There is an example in examples/gtkglarea/.


WARNINGS and HINTS:

Make sure your program links to libgtkgl, not to libgtkgl-2.0. Linking to
libgtkgl-2.0 will result in mixing gtk1 and gtk2 in your program/IDE, which
will result in al kinds of strange errors, including freezing your
windowmanager.
You can find out, what libs were linked to your program with the ldd program:

[]$ ldd yourprogram


For *BSD:

In the fpc file dllfuncs.pp all external functions link to lib dl.

These functions are in libc under *BSD, so should read
external lib "c" for FreeBSD. If you don't, building lazarus will bomb
out with a "can't find lib -ldl" error while linking.

Fixed compiled units working with 1.0.10 are in

ToDo:
Add an example using the package.
