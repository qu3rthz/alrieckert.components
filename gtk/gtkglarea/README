Package GtkOpenGL

Contains the lcl component TGTKGLAreaControl, which wraps the gtkglarea, a
gtk widget for opengl. This component works only with the gtk interface.

There is an example in examples/gtkglarea/.


WARNING:
Make sure your program links to libgtkgl, not to libgtkgl-2.0. Linking to
libgtkgl-2.0 will result in mixing gtk1 and gtk2 in your program/IDE, which
will result in al kinds of strange errors, including freezing your
windowmanager.
You can find out, what libs were linked to your program with the ldd program:

[]$ ldd yourprogram


ToDo:
Add an example using the package.
