cgi

With the cgimodules.pas unit you can easily create cgi applications with
datamodules.

In the IDE sub directory you can find a design time package, which will install
some helpful IDE features like 'Simple CGI Application' and 'Simple CGI Module'.

Note that this package is deprecated in favour of the more advanced lazweb
package: that package supports Apache modules and CGI applications with a
unified structure, using a similar but more elaborate approach.

For very simple CGI programs, cgimodules is still suitable, though.
