The pasjpeg code in the current fpc sources have a bug.
If you want jpeg, then you must use an older fpc and the jpeg from lazarus-ccr
on sourceforge. Not this package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The lazarus TJPEGImage is in lazjpeg.pas

It uses the pasjpeg and fpimage libs provided by FreePascal. See there for in
more detailed jpeg handling.


JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized familly of algorithms for
compression of continous tone still images. Most JPEG processes are lossy,
the output image is not exactly identical to the input image. However, on
typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained
with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible
if you can tolerate a low-quality image. The Independent JPEG Group (IJG) has
created a free, portable C library for JPEG compression and decompression of
JPEG images.
