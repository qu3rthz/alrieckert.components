This package installs Paradox support in the lazarus IDE:

TParadox (Data Access Tab) is a TDataset descendent that enables you to open
and see Paradox tables. It has support for Blobs and Graphics. There is no
need to have the BDE from Borland (Codegear) installed, you do need the
PXlib library, which you can download from Sourceforge:

http://pxlib.sourceforge.net/

TParadox itself is in the Free Pascal fcl-db package (2.3.1 +).

Enjoy !
